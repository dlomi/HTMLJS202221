<img src="" alt="" width="">
<p>I am a current student at the New England Institute of Technology in the Video Game Development and Design course. I hope to focus more on the game design side of things as I am more well-acquainted with art than with coding. I have prior experience of creating websites due to taking web page design in my senior year at North Kingstown High School. I also have prior experience in working on a video game with RPG Maker for my high school senior project.</p>
<p>I have been interested in the idea of making video games since I was in middle school and had even attempted to even though I had no knowledge about it. It was only until these recent years that I've been able to expose myself to more types of games that I would want to play. Since my high school senior project, I have looked into many of the games that I enjoy and have looked into what has made them successful and what players are unsatisfied with. I hope to learn more in my time at NEIT.</p>
